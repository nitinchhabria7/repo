The assignment is to build a distributable solution that can take a batch of Meetup RSVP data as input, and output a top N (where N is also an input parameter) of trending topics per day. As you will see, within a single RSVP message, Meetup supplies the topics the group has indicated to be about. Our definition of a trending topic includes, but is not limited to, these topics. Considering the meetup title for trending topics is of great value. An RSVP to a meetup is a sign that a person will be attending a meetup (and thus indicates interest in a topic). We loosely define trending topic for a period of time as: words or phrases of which the slope of the frequency of occurrence is largest during this this particular period of time.
Meetup has a nice example web page where you can see RSVP's arriving in real-time [here](http://meetup.github.io/stream/rsvpTicker/)
